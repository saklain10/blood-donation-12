/* DaisyUI plugin import (if you are using DaisyUI) */
/* If you are using DaisyUI as a PostCSS plugin via tailwind.config.js,
   you usually don't need a direct @import here for DaisyUI's CSS.
   However, if you uncommented "@plugin "daisyui";" previously,
   it was incorrect syntax. You might need to adjust tailwind.config.js instead.
   Let's keep it simple and rely on tailwind.config.js for DaisyUI.
